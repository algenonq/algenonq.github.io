In the beginning was the pen. The pen is old.  Calligraphy is old. 

In the arts and crafts movement of the late nineteenth century, there was a revival of interest in calligraphy. The tradition continues.

While calligraphy itself constantly changes the supporting tools and techniques have been around for centuries. Some of the composition tools (guidelines, templates, layout) are quite manually intensive. In the age of instant feedback, preparation dulls participation. The ToolBox is here to simplify the path from idea to creation.

Where to begin?
---------------

At the begining. 

###What?
1. Speeding up the creation process
2. Layout and Composition assistance
3. Inspiration of new ideas

###How?
1. Guideline Generators for printing (speed)
2. Shaped Guideline Generators (speed,layout)
3. Versals (layout, inspiration)
4. Borders and Knots (speed, inspiration)
5. Layout (layout, speed)

###Why?
1. I need to learn front end web technologies
2. I want to challenge my design skills
3. Layout will be technically very challenging
4. I want these tools for my own projects

So there you have it. In a nutshell I am providing a set of tools to help with my calligraphy projects which will hopefully benefit others.

The ToolBox will not be limited to the first set of tools. I suspect as people use the site, they will give feedback/contribute new tools.

###Philosophy
This project is my first attempt at a totally client based web toolkit, in fact it will by my first public website. It will be constructed using a variety of open libraries and tools. I see no need to hide my work. Infact I hope others will learn from it. Also I hope to learn from any contributions or forks. I am sure there are many more talented devs than myself out there, just as I am sure that some of these tools may find uses beyond calligraphy. Consequently, the project will remain open for use and modification by others.

Any code will remain open under the MIT 2 paragraph licence.

The documentation as such will be released under the creative commons licence with the only requirement being attribution to the author.

The Plan
--------
So far is to release the tools in stages. 

First up will be guidelines and shapes. These have been done as back-end tools and all I need to do is refactor them for front end javascript access.

The website will use the bootstrap framework and angular.js. 

I am not anticipating supporting anything other than the latest HTML5 capable browsers.

The other tools will be developed once the first two are stable.


cheers
