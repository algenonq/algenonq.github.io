Application architecture and a discussion of how it might all fit togetherâ€¦

#Application Architecture

##What is the application? 


Well it is a loose collection of useful calligraphy tools, sharing a common user interface. I want the application to have consistent usage between the tools because the computer literacy of the intended users is low.

Each of the tools will generate a PDF as the outcome. The user is then expected to print the PDF use with calligraphy projects.

##What are the tools?

Not an exhaustive list but these are the planned tools. Each will be described in more detail in later posts.

+ *Guidelnes* - Guidelines are used under calligraphy work to keep letter proportions and spacing under control
+ *Shapes* - Sometimes you want to write in spirals or squares etc. 
+ *Versals* - Versals are the large capital letters at the start of a passage. This tool will help with composition.
+ *Celtic Knots* - Knots are easiest drawn on a special grid. This will help creating grids and simple knots. 
+ *Borders* - This is kind of a thought bubble at the moment. Thinking of some common vector shapes (leaves, flowers, geometric shapes) and some sort of algorithm for joining them up fancily.
+ *layout* - The hardest and the first tool that I wanted. Take a picture of a draft and move around in the browser for help with composition.
