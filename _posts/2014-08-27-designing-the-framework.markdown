So I had a working jquery and [ink](http://ink.sapo.pt) app. Well kind of working.

I am currently transitioning to [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [angular](https://angularjs.org/).

The bootstrap transition is relatively straight forward. Most of the grid and common controls play nicely. I am going to use the angular bootstrap library [Angular bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap). I have a reasonable idea of the design of the app. I will be including a styleguide in the project.

However, I am new to angular. I am currently breaking down the application into modules, services, partials etc. It is quite straight forward but I need some common modules for generating pdf, configuration, logging etc. I am gong to do these locally in the [seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project for angular before uploading to github. I hope in the next day or so to blog the architecture of the application and a roadmap of implementation.

Cheers aQ
