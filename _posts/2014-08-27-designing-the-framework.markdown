So I had a working jquery and [ink](http://ink.sapo.pt/ink "ink web user interface framework") app. Well kind of working. 

I am currently transitioning to [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap web user interface framework") and [angular](https://angularjs.org/ "angular javascript library"). 

The bootstrap transition is relatively straight forward. Most of the grid and common controls play nicely. I am going to use the angular bootstrap library [Angular bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap "Angular bootstrap library"). I have a reasonable idea of the design of the app. I will be including a styleguide in the project.

However, I am new to angular. I am currently breaking down the application into modules, services, partials etc. It is quite straight forward but I need some common modules for generating pdf, configuration, logging etc. I am gong to do these locally in the [seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed "Angular seed project") project for angular before uploading to github. I hope in the next day or so to blog the architecture of the application and a roadmap of implementation.

Cheers
