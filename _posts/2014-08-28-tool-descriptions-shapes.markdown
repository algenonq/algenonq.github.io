Part 2 - in the description of each of the tools included in the tool box. Shape templates help you write around corners.

Shapes
------

###Rationale
Sometimes straight lines aren’t enough. There are many examples of calligraphy in the form of a spiral, an oval, concentric circles etc. The possibilities are endless. Some of these shapes are a pain to draw. This tool will generate a pdf with a shape template which can be printed and used as a guideline in the creative process.

###Shapes
Broadly there will be a few shapes. Proportions may be changed and details such as x-height guidelines may be added to each.

I don’t want to use the term polygon. Calligraphers are not necessarily mathematically or technically minded.

The basic shapes are:

+ rectangle: square through rectangle. Possibly rhombus and trapezoid or other quadrilaterals… 
+ ellipse: circle through oval. may stretch x or y direction.  
+ spiral: specify tightness and start point. May be non-arc (e.g. rectangular, hex-angular etc
+ triangle: stretch base and/or height.

Each shape may have an optional x-height line to guide writing. it will become too cluttered to include full guidelines.

Closed polygon shapes may be nested concentrically around the centre point. 

Measurements for dimensions will be in mm.

Measurements for the x-height line will be in nib-widths.

###Options
- Darkness: As guidelines are placed beneath the worksheet, they can sometimes be hard to see even with a light-box. The weight and colour of lines must be configurable.
- Verticals: Beginners often have trouble with keeping letters vertical. It is sometimes useful to draw vertical “reminders” periodically along the guideline. The “vertical may be set to an angle for sloped scripts like in the italic style.
- Shaded X: Sometimes it is hard to distinguish the x-height lines from the ascender and descender lines. Use this to fill between the x-height lines with hatches or solid colour.
- Description: text to be printed at the top of the page to denote the script chosen etc.

###Interaction
I envisage this tool having a dynamic canvas which reflects the guideline choices as they are made. This canvas may be an image or may indeed be a pdf - depending on performance. 

Simple x-y adjustment controls if possible.

Paper dimensions must include A2,A3,A4 and B5?. Also Letter. What about envelopes? hmmm.

The generated guideline pdfs are to be downloaded from the browser and saved. It is up to the user to print from there. Perhaps a print view which opens a new page with the pdf?

### Workflow
Experienced: Choose the shape -> adjust -> choose options -> save -> print
