After long consideration of jquery vs angular vs other framework, I have decided to go with angular. The main reason is that I like the modular and testable nature of the code. I also appreciate the plug-in pattern (dependency injection) nature of the framework. It is very powerful. The ability to create new tags in HTML is nice and expressive too. 

The cons are obvious. It is kind of a cross between javascript and something new. Its markup syntax clashes with just about every server side markup syntax. It can be a bit convoluted, but i think in terms of readability, that may not be a bad thing.

There are a plethora of tutorials on the angular site, and also at egghead.io. 

We also have an angular-centric environment at work, so what better way to play around with it than to build a site with a little client side complexit. 

Next you're going to ask why the toolkit is not generating pdfs at the server side? There are two reasons:
1. simplicity. it is simpler to server "static" site. 
2. focus. I only wanted to use client side libraries.
3. To see if I could do it.

There may be some minimal server side storage implemented in the future - but I have no plans at the moment for anything other than dynamically created content.
