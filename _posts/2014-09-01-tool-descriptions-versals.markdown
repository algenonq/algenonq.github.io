Part 3 - in the description of each of the tools included in the tool box. Versals are the large capitals often historiated or illuminated at the beginning of a passage.

Versals
-------

###Rationale 
Often, one wants to emphasise the opening letter of a passage with a versal. These can be illuminated or historiated, or simply a larger version of the following script. The trouble is that they can be a bit of a pain to draw by hand because of their size in relation to the rest of the script.

###Versals 
The versals available will be sourced from scalable fonts. I intend to include a few styles such as uncial, gothic, roman etc. The idea is that the calligrapher will use this tool to choose a letter in correct proportion for their script, and to adjust its location on the page. It will be up to the calligrapher to decorate the letter or add specific details for scripts which are not available in computer fonts.

Letter sizes and positions shall conform to the golden rectangle if possible. 

Lorem ipsum type can be optionally displayed to show the flow of lines around the versal. X-height, and interlinear measurements can be adjusted.

Measurements for dimensions will be in mm.

Measurements for the x-height line will be in nib-widths.

###Options
+ Weight: The weight and colour of the letter must be configurable. 
+ Border: Optional border
+ Lorem Ipsum: Optional indicative text
+ Position: Top left, Left Column,  Other...

###Interaction 
I envisage this tool having a dynamic canvas which reflects the letter and measurement choices as they are made. This canvas may be an image or may indeed be a pdf - depending on performance.

Simple x-y adjustment controls if possible.

Paper dimensions must include A2,A3,A4 and B5?. Also Letter. What about envelopes? hmmm.

The generated guideline pdfs are to be downloaded from the browser and saved. It is up to the user to print from there. Perhaps a print view which opens a new page with the pdf?

### Workflow

Experienced: Choose the letter -> adjust -> choose options -> save -> print
